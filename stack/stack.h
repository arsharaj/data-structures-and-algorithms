/*
Stack is a list restricted to insert and delete element from only one side which is called as the
top of the stack.
Stack is a very crucial data structure to understand since it has a wide range of applications.
Some of them are brackets matching used in lexical scoping, function calls, recursion, and many 
more.
We can perform mainly two major operations on stack and that is push() and pop()
I have also implemented print() method just for sake of understanding. Ideal implementations does
not provide this thing.
