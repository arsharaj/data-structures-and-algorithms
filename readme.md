# Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementation as well as abstract view of some well known data structures like trees, stacks, queues, etc.

## Motivation

Since data structure and algorithm is one of the important and core subject of Computer 
Science so in order to strengthen my learning and make it much more interesting I made
this project open source so that I could get valuable suggestion from developers who are
more experienced than me and help out those who are just getting started.


## Prerequisites

1. Git
2. C and C++ Compilers (preferably gcc and g++)

These two things should be setup onto your system.


## Installation

Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to setup this project.

Navigate to the directory where you want to keep the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arsharaj/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
```
A folder will be created in your present work directory. Rename this folder whatever you want. ðŸ˜€


## Usage

You will find different folders in this project repo. 

Each folder contain many header files and only one **app.c** or **app.cpp** file.
This is the only runner file in that folder and needs to be compiled.

```bash
# Navigate to the folder you are interested in or want to play with.
# Run either of the two commands depending on the file extension.

gcc app.c

g++ app.cpp
```

This command will generate a **a.out** file in the same folder.

Run this file using this command.
```bash
./a.out
```

## Contributing

*Suggestions* are valuable.
You can contribute to this project by suggesting some algorithms and data strutures 
that have not yet been implemented. 

*Typos* are really hard to get rid of. I am not sure that I have not made any. This is 
silly to say but you can help me in removing any typos that I could have made in this 
project.

Obviously this repository is not for advance programmers. It is for the beginners who 
are just getting started but I am sure that over time advance programmers will also find 
relevant things here.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
